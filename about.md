<p>I romanticized the idea of having a skill to make literally something out of nothing. Coding is something that I stumbled upon a few years ago. Without much knowledge about it at the time, following it for years, a desire for something more rewarding, and the inability to suppress my curiosity any longer; I decided to take a leap of faith and pursue a new skill. I just wanted to do amazing work with brilliant people.</p>

<p>Aside from all of the languages and technologies, I've learned that I will always be learning in this field. That I am more resilient than I was when I started and to constantly strive for growth as a developer. That it's ok if you don't know the answer right away because if there isn't a solution, we can make one. I have a super power now and I will not be afraid to use it.</p>
